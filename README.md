# Link Page v2

## Project Description
This project was created with the attempt to make my own version of the current website Linktree. Linktree is a website that allows users to put all their social media links on one page web page. Since that solution is a paid offering and it is just a website, I decided to develop my own.

This project is the second iteration of this information. The original iteration was created with HTML/CSS and vanilla JS. This one is utilizing React.
